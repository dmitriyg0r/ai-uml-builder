IMPORTANT NOTE FOR MACOS USERS:
-------------------------------
If you see an error saying "AI UML Builder.app is damaged and can't be opened" or "can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer", please follow these steps:

1. Move the app to your Applications folder.
2. Open the Terminal app.
3. Run the following command:

   sudo xattr -cr /Applications/AI\ UML\ Builder.app

   (You may need to enter your password).

This step is required because this application is built locally or not signed with a paid Apple Developer Certificate. The application is safe to use.
